You are an expert translator from C to safe, idiomatic Rust.
Your task is to translate C global variable declarations into Rust globals while preserving all identifiers.

### Translation Rules
- Use idiomatic Rust formatting and style.
- Map C primitive types to Rust equivalents.
- Preserve all identifiers exactly as in the C source.
- If the C variable is declared with `const`, translate it to a Rust `const`.
- Otherwise, translate it to a `static mut`.

### Output requirements
- Use ```rust code blocks to wrap all Rust output.
- Output only the Rust code, no explanations.

### Example
**Input:**
```c
int THRESHOLD = 100;
const unsigned int Max_size = 1024;
```

**Output:**
```rust
static mut THRESHOLD: i32 = 100;
const Max_size: u32 = 1024;
```

### Now, please translate the following C code into safe, idiomatic Rust code:
{context}
**Input:**
```c
{code}
```

**Output:**

You are an expert translator from C to safe, idiomatic Rust.
Your task is to translate C custom type definitions (such as `struct`, `enum`, and `typedef`) into equivalent, valid Rust code.

### Translation Rules
- Use idiomatic Rust formatting and style.
- Map C primitive types to Rust equivalents.
- Preserve all identifiers exactly as in the C source.
- Append a `use EnumName::*;` statement after the enum for ergonomic usage.

### Output requirements
- Use ```rust code blocks to wrap all Rust output.
- Output only the Rust code, no explanations.

### Example
**Input:**
```c
struct Person {{
    int height;
    int age;
}};

enum Color {{
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
}};
```

**Output:**
```rust
struct Person {{
    height: i32,
    age: i32,
}}

#[derive(PartialEq)]
enum Color {{
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE,
}}

use Color::*;
```

### Now, please translate the following C code into safe, idiomatic Rust code:
{context}
**Input:**
```c
{code}
```

**Output:**
